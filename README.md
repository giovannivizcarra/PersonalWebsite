# Personal Website

Welcome, I created a personal website to show recruiters my work. This was my first time creating a website and I definetly learned a lot from it! 

I only included the main layout I used to create my personal website, https://gvizcarra.appspot.com/, which I am hosting on Google's App Engine. Note that the script does not include the files needed to host a website on its own, as mentioned above it is onlt the main layout of the site.
