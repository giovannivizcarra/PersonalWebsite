     <h4>Abstract</h4>
     <p>Quantum random access memory is the theoretical quantum analog of classical random access memory otherwise known as RAM. Quantum random access memory uses quantum parallelism to query data, and is an essential component to a lot of quantum algorithms. In 2008 Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 160501 (2008)] introduced the bucket brigade quantum random access memory oracle model (qRAM). This model has been thoroughly studied for over a decade. The bucket brigade model still faces a lot of setbacks in terms of errors related to a faulty oracle and engineering limitations. This paper will provide a literary review of qRAM while providing a comprehensive overview on the bucket brigade model, its applications, and limitations.
</p>
     <h4>Introduction</h4>
     <p>Random access memory played an essential role in the development of the digital technologies and information processing, which require access to large data storages. Having both read and write capabilities makes RAM useful for situations where large amounts data need to be accessed and changed frequently[4]. While we may depend on classical RAM the demand for data continues to make quantum RAM an interesting point of study and focus. 

<p>In theory the standard model of quantum RAM would give access to a superposition of N = 2n memory cells containing either classical or quantum information using n qubits [11]. [3] mentions how qRAM is widely applicable to oracle based algorithms, specifically those that store classical information but require quantum parallelism. The paper lists algorithms such as Grover's search on a classical database, collision finding, element distinctness, etc. Despite its wide range of applications, actually implementing a model of qRAM has been heavily criticized amongst researchers, in regards to cost and difficulty of implementation [3, 5].</p> 

<p>One of the greatest challenges is maintaining quantum parallelism, due to decoherence. Avoiding oracle related errors is also extremely unfeasible without proper error correction which, which may remove any quantum advantage from the algorithm [5]. However, possible applications to quantum machine learning [10] continues to keep qRAM alive and well in the hopes and dreams of many researchers and venture capitalists. This paper provides an exploratory literary review of qRAM, using the bucket brigade model proposed by Giovannetti, LLoyd, and Maccone in 2008.</p>
  <h4>Literary Review</h4>
    <p>There is a significant amount of studies on quantum memories and its applications towards quantum information processing. Being the first qRAM proposal, the bucket brigade scheme has been studied by a variety of researchers. It is important to empathize that the bucket brigade model of qRAM serves only as an illustrative example for qRAM and has had no experimental realization. The work that will be discussed in regards to the bucket brigade model is purely theoretical. The first section covers the bucket brigade scheme in relation to classical RAM. The paper then studies the different possible applications of qRAM, focusing specifically on machine learning algorithms. Concluding the literary review, by studying the limitations of qRAM. 
  
  <h4>Bucket Brigade Model</h4>
  <p>Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone provides an illustrative example of how the bucket brigade model works using conventional RAM architectures. Classical RAM structures address N memory cells with an n bit string, Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone paper mentions how, “the address register a must contain a superposition of addresses , and the qRAM will return a superposition of data in a data register d, correlated with the address register  where  is the content of the jth memory cell,” [11]. Therefore, Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone required that true quantum RAM would be able to maintain a large superposition between the index and output registers.</p>
  <p>Due to the use of quantum parallelism, maintaining coherence throughout the apparatus raises concerns regarding the feasibility of a true quantum RAM which will be discussed further in the last section.  Assuming the bucket brigade architecture is able to avoid decoherence, Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone argued that the bucket brigade model will reduce the amount of switches necessary to perform a memory call from N switches used in classical architectures to O(log N) switches [11]. This reduction in gates would in theory eliminate the weakly connected superposition’s necessary to use qRAM, thus increasing the coherence in the system. The bucket brigade model provides an exponential reduction in the amount of gates that need to be activated when addressing the memory [2]. </p>

  <p>The bucket brigade model is typically described using a bifurcation graph as in [Figure 1] which uses three level system quantum systems known as qutrits rather than qubits. The qutrits are located in the nodes of the bifurcation graph (Figure 1) [2]. The three level system is then categorized as either a wait,left,right state, corresponding to the path the physical state will take. [11] explains that qutrits in the left or right  state are programed to change the direction of the signal based on the specific energy level the bit has.  Using qutrits is useful for the bucket brigade model as it allows you to maintain the atom in the wait, left, right state [11].  It is important to emphasize that all the nodes in the binary tree remain in the wait state when querying the memory, except for the nodes along the path traced out by the memory call.</p>
  <p> According to Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone, specifically making a call to the memory cell will not active the other nodes and create a highly entangled system, and entanglement will lead to decoherence. This makes the bucket brigade an interesting theoretical idea. Once the specific nodes are activated in the binary tree as seen in [Figure 2] and information is stored in their respective nodes, a bus qubit is sent through the apparatus to copy the value of the memory cells. This would in turn reduce the complexity of the system since qRAM only requires O(n) calls to gain access to a specific memory cells. Once the results of a qRAM query is given, the bucket brigade model requires that all the nodes are reset to the wait state.  </p>
  <p>Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone, provided a form of physically implementing a quantum random access memory following the bucket brigade model they proposed. Given the current state of our technology, the 2008 approach at quantum random access memory is still unrealistic and unfeasible which will be discussed later in the paper [3, 5, 11]. The physical implementation of the bucket brigade model requires that the qutrits are initialized in the ground state energy level [2, 11]. Such that only the qutrits following the path mapped out by the index address are in excited energy states.   </p>
  <p>Figure 3 presents an example of how the qRAM might look in real light, but serves only as an illustrative example. The apparatus uses light matter coupling to create a three level system [Figure 4]. The index register is made up of qubits that are encoded into the photons polarization. An interaction with the trapped atoms changes the energy state in the qutrit in order to locate a specific memory cell [2, 5, 11]. Recall that the nodes in a binary tree represent the trapped atoms typically in the ground state, except when light matter coupling is used to allocate a specific path to our memory cell. A bus qubit is sent throughout the apparatus along the excited states path to copy the values of the memory cell. The paper empathizes the delicacy in picking the specific energy levels the three level system will have.  </p>
  <p>[11] requires that the energy difference between the ground state of the atom is a lot greater than the energy difference between the first two excited states of the system. In doing so the we reduce the probability for a node in the wait state (atom in the ground state) to  incorrectly transition to an excited state. This is essential to the bucket brigade model, since the model depends on the O(n) complexity, generated from only activating a specific path along the bifurcation graph, and keeping the rest in the wait state. Therefore, the signal is less likely to be rerouted along an incorrect path. </p>
  <p>When Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone introduced their model they emphasize the point that the physical apparatus they described was only an illustrative example due to the limitations the apparatus had. Nonetheless, the work done on qRAM since its proposal have spread a lot of research done in terms of applications of qRAM and its limitations. In the following section I will talk about a couple of different applications, the bucket brigade model of qRAM would have.  </p>
  <h4>Applications</h4>
  <p>A form of qRAM is essential to a lot of oracle based algorithms, as qRAM plays the role of the oracle in these algorithms. One in particular includes Grover’s search algorithm on a classical database [11]. Grover’s search algorithm conducts a search over an unsorted list to find a specific value. Grover’s search algorithm requires the use of a quantum oracle to provide a quadratic speed up, over classical search problems which takes O(N) operations [8]. Although, Grover’s algorithm is an extremely important application, recent work [5] points out that quantum search problems would require a super polynomial amount of queries in n causing the error rate to scale super-polynomially in n, leading to extensive error corrections, which raise concerns.</p>
  <p>Another important oracle based application of qRAM that came to light a year after the bucket brigade model is the Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd HHL algorithm published in 2009 [6]. The HHL algorithm claims to solve linear systems of equations offering an exponential speed up over classical linear systems of equations problems [9].</p>
  <p>Given a N x N Hermitian matrix A and a vector b, the HHL algorithm finds the vector x corresponding to Ax = b [6, 9]. Solving linear systems of equations is an instrumental part of science therefore, having an algorithm that responds faster than it would in the classical domain, makes the HHL algorithm special.  [9] talks about how a quantum random access memory is needed to be able to apply the HHL algorithm. </p>
  <p>The HHL algorithm has paved the way for a lot of different applications to quantum machine learning algorithms that only require a polynomial amount of queries in n [5]. Therefore, emphasizing the importance of applying a fault tolerant qRAM. The HHL algorithm is assumed to solve problems in O(log(N)κ2s2/ε ) time. Such that κ is the ratio of the largest and smallest eigenvalues in the equation, s is defined to be, “sparsity or the maximum number of non-zero entries in a row and column of A” [10], and ε is the precision. For nearly a decade the HHL algorithm has given hope to the quantum machine learning community, due to the wide range of applications the HHL algorithms has, specifically in machine learning. </p>
  <p>However, last year 18-year-old student Ewin Tang published a series of papers [1, 12, 13] which offers a classical algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. The new classical algorithm offers a similar speed to that in the HHL paper but using classical technology which devalued the HHL algorithm and a lot of QML algorithms that followed, [12]. Despite the negative press associated with the HHL algorithms, Tangs algorithm only applies to low rank matrices offering some hope for HHL algorithm since it deals with sparse matrices [13, 14].   </p>
  <p>Oracle based algorithms continue to motivate research towards building a quantum random access memory like the bucket brigade model. Given that the HHL is still viable in the next years, its impact may be the drive towards building a quantum random access memory due to the current influence machine learning is having on society. Nonetheless, current work relating to the status of quantum random memory has a grim perspective in regards to feasibility of building the apparatus, as I will discuss in the next section. </p>
  <h4>Limitations</h4>

  <p>From the beginning Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone clarified that their model would only serve as an example of qRAM due to the limitations it had. [5] criticizes qRAM by studying the model presented in [11, 2]. The paper makes the argument that qRAM will need an extensive amount of error correction to properly function [5]. These criteria would make the system extremely unfeasible given the state of our technology. [5], studies the error associated with a call to the oracle. </p>
  <p>[5], provides an example circuit following the bucket brigade circuit scheme in Figure 5. Following this model, the paper goes on in studying the probability of errors due to a faulty oracle. The research paper [5] offers the following error model corresponding the bucket brigade scheme described in [11]. ) The error model depicted represents the probability that the bucket brigade qRAM presented in [11], followed the correct path,  refers to the probability of it following the wrong path, is the probability of it following no path, refers to the error per gate, and n refers to 2n memory locations in the qRAM. This error model is given to discredit both qRAM and the bucket brigade model. The error simply emphasize the unfeasibility of having a quantum random access memory in the near future.</p>
  <p>Figure 6 shows the graph [5] provided to describe their error model in the case of a fixed error per gave value . Figure 6 unfortunately shows that the probability for the bucket brigade qRAM model to follow the proper path mapped out by the index register is grim. The graph demonstrates that when you increase the amount of memory in your system the probability that no path is mapped out by the index register increases. On the other hand, the probability of obtaining the correct path mapped out by the index register is decreased. Figure 7 is another study of the error model presented in [5]; however, instead of having a fixed error gate we have a fixed n and obtained the same unsatisfactory results as before. Therefore, demystifying both the bucket brigade model and the hope for a near term fault tolerant quantum random access memory.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, errors that are caused by a faulty oracle require deep error correction, due to the error model seen in [5]. Although, [5] was published in 2015, technology has not changed enough to have a qRAM as described by Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone in 2008, with their bucket brigade model. A recent paper from the University of Waterloo and TRIUMF [3] use the circuit presented in [5] to study the cost of fault tolerantly implementing the qRAM as described by the Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone papers. The paper also provides a negative outlook in terms of our engineering capabilities. The bucket brigade model continues to need an unrealistic amount of resources to physically build.  </p>
  <p>[3], presents a numerical analysis to show how unfeasible building an actual quantum random access memory is in 2019. By theoretically studying a 4KB quantum random access memory following the bucket brigade model, [3], found that quarrying the 4KB qRAM with 100 million qubits would take about 350,000ns while conventional RAM architectures have query speeds up to 10ns. Therefore, classical RAM architectures still has a lot of advantages over the proposed theoretical qRAM model studied. Physically implementing an actual quantum random access memory apparatus following the bucket brigade model would then be unfeasible given the current state of our technology. As one can imagine 100,000 million qubits is extremely expensive as well as sensitive to decoherence. [3] also discusses a variety of intermediate solutions to qRAM, and provides simpler models which may be more effective given the technology we have, but that is beyond the scope of the paper as I am focusing on the bucket brigade scheme. </p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Given the wide variety of applications discussed throughout this paper, makes quantum random access memory important. Quantum random access memory has very large shoes to fill if it wants to beat classical RAM architectures. Currently the bucket brigade model continues to be the most studied version of qRAM presented. As aforementioned, qRAM has a wide verity of applications such as Grover’s search algorithm and the Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. The HHL algorithm motivated the study and creation of a lot of quantum machine learning algorithms. Some of the quantum machine learning algorithms using HHL have also faced criticisms as there appears to now be a classical analog to the Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd algorithm which provides a faster speed up in a non-quantum system (as discussed in the previous section).</p>
  <p> Recent work has truly demystified a lot of the hype associated with the bucket brigade model. Nonetheless, the search for a quantum analog of RAM does not appear to go anywhere. With even a group from Tsinghua University, in Beijing claiming to have an Experimental realization of 105-qubit random access quantum memory [15]. However, the subject was beyond the scope of this paper as it was supposed to provide an overview of qRAM using the most standard model, which was the bucket brigade model. </p>
