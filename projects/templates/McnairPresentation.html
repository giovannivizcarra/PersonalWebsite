     <h1>MCNAIR PRESENTATION: ATOM INTERFEROMETRY SENSOR NETWORK</h1>
     <h4>Abstract</h4>
     <p>Leading atom interferometers are constantly facing hurdles relating to precision due to drift in power levels causing the atom source to be unstable. Atom interferometers work with atoms at the quantum scale which requires extreme attention due to the environmental sensitivity of the atoms; this experiment specifically uses cesium atoms. Like light interferometers, atom interferometers use the property of quantum mechanics, that matter behaves as a wave. We are able to use pulses of light to transfer momentum into atoms, which superimposes the atom along different paths. The interference patterns created by the path difference has pushed our understanding of the quantum world. In order for experiments to work; however, the atoms must be cooled near absolute zero otherwise the atoms are too chaotic to gather any precise measurement. Any small fluctuation in laser power causes alignment drift which requires realigning the optics accordingly. Prior to realignment there is no way of knowing the source of the problem causing inconsistencies with the data. With the aid of Dr. Holger MuÌˆller, I propose to create a sensor network for the Cesium Cavity Interferometer that will help monitor and control interferometers laser power. Both an Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) and small single board computer (Raspberry Pi) will be used to gather and process data for the atom interferometer. The monitoring system will gather the power levels of the apparatus as an electrical signal which will then return a digital output of the laser power levels to reduce the error. Using this sensor network, I hope to better monitor the atom interferometer to help improve the alignment of the optics.</p>
